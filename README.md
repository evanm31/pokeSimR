# PokeSim R - Pokemon Similarity App

This is an R Shiny app that calculates cosine similarity between Pokemon through a numeric matrix calculated from their primary and secondary types, stats, generation, and more. Additionally, it provides a heatmap to visualize relationships between Pokemon on a larger scale and an interactive data table to explore.
